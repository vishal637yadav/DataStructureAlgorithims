# What are Data Structures
* We live in information age.
* As a developer wee need to process the data.

Lots of data leads to :
* Slowdown : 
* Speed : Huge data slows down.
* Multi search : Multiple user search request
>[!NOTE]
> Data Structure is simply a way to store and organize information appropriately, so that it can be used efficiently.

## Advantages of data structures:
* Easier processing of data
* Efficient functioning of computer software

## Categorization of Data Structures(based on **how they can be _accessed_**)
1. Linear Accessed :
    * Array
    * LinkedList
    * Stack
    * Queue
2. Non-linear Accessed :
    * Trees
    * Graph

## Categorization of Data Structures(based on **how they can be _stored_**)
1. Linearly stored :In Memory data is stored on **continuous memory location**.
    * Array
2. Non-Linearly stored :In Memory data is stored at **random location** and **access using pointers**.
    * LinkedList

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * Trees
> * Graph
> * Stack
> * Queue 
> * Depends on their implementation that they are linearly stored of Non-Linearly Stored.
